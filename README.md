Galxe Raffle Tracker Extension Privacy Policy

Effective Date: 13 03 2024

**Introduction**

The Galxe Raffle Tracker Extension ("Extension", "we", "our", or "us") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy outlines how we collect, use, and safeguard your information when you use our Extension. By using the Galxe Raffle Tracker Extension, you agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this policy.

**Information Collection and Use**

The Extension is designed to enhance your experience on the Galxe platform by tracking your raffle participations and winnings, and providing timely notifications about new wins. To provide these services, we need to collect and use certain information:

Authentication Data: To verify your identity and access your raffle information, we use MetaMask for authentication. We do not store your private keys or seed phrases. Only your public Ethereum address is used to identify your participations and winnings on the Galxe platform.

Preferences and Settings: We store your preferences and settings locally on your device using browser storage to maintain your user experience without the need to reconfigure settings each time you use the Extension.

Raffle Data: We collect information about the raffles you participate in and win. This includes raffle names, participation dates, and winning status, which are fetched directly from the Galxe platform via their public API.

**Data Sharing and Disclosure**

We do not share or disclose any of your information with third parties except as described below:

With Your Consent: We may share your information with third parties when we have your explicit consent to do so.

For Legal Reasons: We may disclose your information if required by law or if we believe in good faith that such action is necessary to comply with legal obligations, protect our rights or property, prevent fraud, or protect the safety of our users or the public.

**Data Security**

We take reasonable measures to protect your information from unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure, or destruction. However, no internet-based service is completely secure, so we cannot guarantee the absolute security of your information.

**Your Rights**

You have the right to access, correct, or delete your personal information stored by the Extension. You can manage your preferences and settings directly within the Extension interface. If you wish to request deletion of your data, please contact us at the details provided below.

**Changes to This Privacy Policy**

We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page and updating the effective date at the top. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes.
